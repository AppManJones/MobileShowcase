/// A modifier that adds a spray effect to a view, where particles are emitted and animated.
/**
 Performance Note: Transitioning from `ZStack` to `Canvas`.
 
 Originally, this particle effect was implemented using a `ZStack` to layer and animate particles over the content. However, when multiple instances of the effect were used simultaneously (e.g., across many images), performance degraded due to `ZStack`'s handling of view composition and layout. Transitioning to `Canvas` has significantly improved performance for the following reasons:
 
 - **`ZStack` Performance**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Ideal for layering a small number of views.
     - Works well with simple layouts and infrequent animations.
     - Easy to implement within SwiftUI's view hierarchy.
   - **Cons**:
     - Inefficient when handling many overlapping views, especially with animations.
     - Causes high CPU and memory usage due to constant recomposition of each view.
     - Poor scalability when adding dynamic, animated elements like particles.
 
 - **`Canvas` Performance**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Optimized for drawing large numbers of particles directly on the screen without going through SwiftUIâ€™s view hierarchy.
     - Handles continuous animations and high particle counts more efficiently.
     - Reduces computational load by offloading work to the GPU, making particle effects smoother across many views.
   - **Cons**:
     - Requires more manual control over rendering, positions, and drawing contexts.
     - Lacks some built-in SwiftUI conveniences, such as transitions and automatic view animations.
 
 In this context, transitioning from `ZStack` to `Canvas` reduces memory overhead and improves animation performance, especially when there are many particle effects on the screen at the same time. `Canvas` is ideal for scenarios where complex drawing tasks or a large number of animated elements are involved.
